Scenario
  Amazing Aerospace Inc. produces advanced instrumentation for numerous spacecrafts, and interplanetary exploration equipment manufactured by major aerospace industries. The management wants the company to create new instrumentation and improve existing instruments to compete in a growing aerospace market. The company recently hired over two hundred new employees. Among those are Product Managers, Project Managers, and development team professionals. Amazing Inc. plans to use a combination of traditional project management and Agile Scrum techniques to build its products. Sal Mason is the Amazing Inc. CEO. He identifies and shares some company challenges with the new project management team. Here is his partial list:
1. Many new hires are experts in traditional project management methods. Unfortunately, they only have a general working knowledge of Agile and Scrum practices.
2. Most of the new development team members are conditioned to work autonomously. Integrating these skilled technical experts into a team will be a crucial challenge. Building a team may be more complicated based on the necessary functions or silos the organization employs out of necessity.
3. Sal notices during initial interviews that many new hires have a wide variety of opinions on how to organize and conduct daily operations. He notices that some share solid convictions and are outspoken.
4. Some new managers have had unpleasant experiences using Agile methodology in their previous organizations. One senior manager stated, 'Agile keeps management in the dark. Communication and collaboration are limited. Traditional project management is a better approach for what we want to accomplish.'
5. Senior management is debating the pertinence and needs of specific Product Owner and Scrum Master roles. Some managers suggest maintaining the traditional project management hierarchy and adding additional project and program managers.
6. Developers will encounter several technical challenges. Amazing's product line is highly technical, complex, and requires tremendous innovation. In addition, their leadership disagrees on optimal product specifications and key performance indicators.
7. Finally, Amazing has a highly diverse customer base. These customers often have incredibly diverse requirements that cannot be satisfied by a general product development process. Change is a fact in this industry, and the company must be flexible in addressing those changing requirements.
