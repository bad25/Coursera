## Hands-On Lab: Potential Scrum Master Opportunities

Objectives:
1. Explore Scrum Master opportunities at job posting sites such as Indeed, ZipRecruiter, and so on.
2. Create a list of key skills required to support these positions.
3. Perform a personal skills inventory and derive a list of skills you need to improve.

Task I: Explore job postings
Explore job posting sites for Scrum Master positions in your area. Alternatively, you may simply search for Scrum Master positions in the company of your choice.
Find two postings that interest you. Review the requirements of the position.

Task II: Create a list of key skills required for the position that suits you
Create a list of the skills required to support this position.
Note: You will find that many skills present on the MS spreadsheet are included in the sample job posting.

Task III: Perform a personal skill inventory
Review the skills required for each position.
Use the Scrum Master Skills Inventory Template to perform a skills match analysis. This tool provides a list of Scrum Master skills and competencies and allows you to rate your skills in each category.

Note: 
> Your assessment may differ from the given solution.
> Determine what steps you should take to gain the skills you need to apply for a required Scrum Master position. Focus only on the skill gaps that you need to achieve to reach the skill level of the required job posting.
> Use the Scrum Master Skills Inventory spreadsheet as a guide for the essential skills and competencies a Scrum Master should possess.
