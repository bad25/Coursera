### Case Study: The Role of a Scrum Master

Objectives:
1. Review the scenario.
2. Develop the case study for hiring a Scrum Master.
3. List specific responsibilities a Scrum Master would have in Amazing Aerospace Inc.
4. Define how each role could benefit the firm.
5. Build a list of skills essential to Scrum Master success.

Scenario
  Amazing Aerospace Inc. produces advanced instrumentation for numerous spacecrafts, and interplanetary exploration equipment manufactured by major aerospace industries. The management wants the company to create new instrumentation and improve existing instruments to compete in a growing aerospace market. The company recently hired over two hundred new employees. Among those are Product Managers, Project Managers, and development team professionals. Amazing Inc. plans to use a combination of traditional project management and Agile Scrum techniques to build its products. Sal Mason is the Amazing Inc. CEO. He identifies and shares some company challenges with the new project management team. Here is his partial list:
1. Many new hires are experts in traditional project management methods. Unfortunately, they only have a general working knowledge of Agile and Scrum practices.
2. Most of the new development team members are conditioned to work autonomously. Integrating these skilled technical experts into a team will be a crucial challenge. Building a team may be more complicated based on the necessary functions or silos the organization employs out of necessity.
3. Sal notices during initial interviews that many new hires have a wide variety of opinions on how to organize and conduct daily operations. He notices that some share solid convictions and are outspoken.
4. Some new managers have had unpleasant experiences using Agile methodology in their previous organizations. One senior manager stated, 'Agile keeps management in the dark. Communication and collaboration are limited. Traditional project management is a better approach for what we want to accomplish.'
5. Senior management is debating the pertinence and needs of specific Product Owner and Scrum Master roles. Some managers suggest maintaining the traditional project management hierarchy and adding additional project and program managers.
6. Developers will encounter several technical challenges. Amazing's product line is highly technical, complex, and requires tremendous innovation. In addition, their leadership disagrees on optimal product specifications and key performance indicators.
7. Finally, Amazing has a highly diverse customer base. These customers often have incredibly diverse requirements that cannot be satisfied by a general product development process. Change is a fact in this industry, and the company must be flexible in addressing those changing requirements.

Scenario
Neuro Ability Development (NAD) Inc. specializes in developing a wide line of healthcare products. NAD Inc. has fallen behind the competition in terms of timely product launches. The CEO met with the Marketing Director and requested the marketing team adopt Scrum for certain projects based on the following analysis:

- The healthcare industry is highly competitive. Often, new product ideas and opportunities arise that did not exist during the initial planning phase. Current traditional project methods are slow to react to these opportunities, and the company often lags far behind its competitors. The outcome is a loss of customers and revenue. NAD Inc. has a strong team of skilled and competent traditional project managers. However, none have Scrum experience.
- Various stakeholders, particularly the sales team, need immediate marketing support. They believe their requirements are the top priority. Traditional project management methods frustrate stakeholders and often overwhelm the marketing team. None of the sales and marketing teams are familiar with Scrum. However, they are open to adopting the new methodology to improve their situation.
- Other teams blame the marketing team for being the corporate bottleneck impacting sales and growth. The sales team believes that marketing is slow to react to a rapidly changing environment and often forces product deliveries that are too late or do not work within the targeted segments. The good news is that NAD Inc. has a collocated area shared by marketing, sales, and IT. Employees do not need to go far to collaborate.
- Marketing has numerous customers. Communications and collaboration are fragmented. Work often slows down by a failure to gain the right inputs, review new product ideas or needs, and gain required signoffs. Stakeholders waste time as they can't determine who they need to approach for the decisions that they need to make. NAD Inc. missed numerous opportunities to partner with large retailers to feature their product line. The company's product line is outstanding. Unfortunately, they generally lose their first-mover advantage due to their inefficient product rollout methods.
- The amount of data that you need to process outpaces marketing's ability to analyze the data and make timely decisions. The IT team stated they have adequate technology and skilled personnel to upgrade services and applications. Unfortunately, NAD Inc.'s technology improvements often complete after the competition has brought out similar upgrades. In addition, the number of change requests received during implementation caused further delays, confusion, and technical debt.
- The Marketing Director agrees that there are pressures from every side, the team is slow to react, and a more agile approach is needed. The marketing team must deal with an environment where information cycles are changing rapidly, the way people consume information is dynamic, and to stay competitive, the firm must be able to deliver faster and more frequently. The team understands its customer base and its needs. They need to improve the time to market.
